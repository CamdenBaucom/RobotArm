# RobotArm
#### CHS Engineering 3 Robot Arm Project, By: Camden Baucom and Philip Breen

During this project, we aspired to create a fun and fucntional mechanism controlled with servos and a GUI, a graphical user interface. While researching past Robot Arm projects in the Sigma Lab, we were dissapointed to see how similar and seemingly useless they were, so we decided to move in a completely new and more interesting direction, a Nerf Blaster. We decided to place "**The Blaster**" on a rotating base situated on a bearing which would be controlled by a servo. Then, the vertical positing of "**The Blaster**" would be controlled by two servos that elevate the device above the base. All three of these servos would be controlled by the GUI, allowing us to have a wide range of movement for "**The Blaster**", all while never laying a finger on it. The reving system would be controlled by mounting a relay to the elctronic components inside "**The Blaster**." Finally, the trigger mechanism would be controlled by mounting a simple servo to the device's already established firing components.
